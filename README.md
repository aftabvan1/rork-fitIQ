## Backend Setup

This app requires a backend API to function properly. You have several options:

### Option 1: Use Environment Variables (Recommended)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in your `.env` file:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
   ```

### Option 2: Local Development Backend

If you're running a local backend server:

1. Set up your backend server on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Ensure your backend has the following endpoints:
   - `GET /api/health` - Health check
   - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
   - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
   - `GET /api/user/profile` - Get user profile
   - `GET /api/nutrition/daily/:date` - Get daily nutrition
   - `POST /api/nutrition/meal-entry` - Add meal entry
   - And more... (see `services/api.ts` for full list)

### Option 3: Backend Service Providers

You can use services like:
- **Supabase** - For database and auth
- **Firebase** - For real-time features
- **Railway/Render** - For hosting your backend
- **Vercel/Netlify** - For serverless functions
